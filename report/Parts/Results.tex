\section{Results}
The results of the Behaviour Tree controller submitted to the Initial Ms. PacMan competition\cite{competition} can seen in table \ref{table-compResults}.

The relation between the average scores of the controller against the different ghost controllers are to be expected. Both the Legacy2 and Starter ghost controllers are harder to predict as they have a balance between the all-out aggressive nature of the Aggressive Ghosts and the completely stochastic nature of the Random Ghosts. Because the controller is able to make immediate turnarounds due to the "Flee" behaviour, the Random Ghosts will perform poorly against this controller, as PacMan will rarely be boxed in by them. 

The relative standard deviation of the results show much of the same story, except for the results of the aggressive ghost controllers. If the behaviour of the ghost controllers is entirely deterministic, the standard deviation of the score should be low. It is likely, however, that minuscule timings make the PacMan and/or Ghost controllers make different choices in different playthroughs.
