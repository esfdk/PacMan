\section{Performance Measure}
The controllers in this paper are evaluated by the scores that they achieve in 1000 trials against four different ghost controllers; "Starter Ghosts", "Random Ghosts", "Legacy2TheReckoning", and "Aggressive Ghosts". The controllers will be ranked by their average score over the 1000 trials; additionally, the paper will discuss of the standard deviation of each controller. The results of each of the three controllers will be compared to a Behaviour Tree controller submitted to the Initial Ms. PacMan competition of the Modern AI in Games course at IT-University of Copenhagen, Fall 2014\cite{competition}.
