\section{Introduction}
Ms. PacMan is an old-school arcade game. The player (Ms. PacMan) navigates different mazes, earning points by eating pills and avoiding getting killed by ghosts. Eating a power pill makes Ms. PacMan able to eat the ghosts, earning her points and sending the ghosts back to their lair.

This paper describes three different implementations of a controller used to control Ms. PacMan in the game: a neural network-based controller, a controller using Monte Carlo Tree Search, and a controller using a behaviour tree evolved with an evolutionary algorithm.

The structure of the paper is as follows: first the three approaches are described in detail, second the measurement used to measure performance of each controller is specified, and finally the results of applying the performance measurement to each controller is presented.

This paper is written as part of an individual assignment for the Modern AI in Games course on the third semester of the Master of Games Technology, fall 2014.

During the development of the controllers, I shared ideas and worked with Jacob Claudius Grooss (jcgr@itu.dk).
